# Country Challenge

I took this challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca

REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge hub

I did integrate it with the REST Countries V2 API to pull country data and display it like in the designs.



Built with

Semantic HTML5 markup

CSS custom properties

Vanialla JavaScript



User is able to:

See all countries from the API on the homepage

Search for a country using an input field

Filter countries by region

Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page

Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
